### a.k.a. VideoStreamTracker

This is a Swift SDK package for the Eyevinn Player Analytics Service.

The Swift SDK uses the [Eyevinn Player Analytics Eventsink](https://app.osaas.io/dashboard/service/eyevinn-player-analytics-eventsink) to send events and it is easily added to your project through the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).
